# JSPsych_workshop
As a complement to the video and to the powerpoint presentation, and to make up for the part that was not recorded, I have uploaded here a description and explanation of the steps followed in the workshop.

## Part 1. Tutorial on how to create a webpage
- **Part1_Example_web.md**. Document detailing the process of creating a sample web step-by-step
- **Part1_Example_web_folder**. The HTML file with the finished result of the sample web and a folder with the image that contained the image I used 

## Part 2. Tutorial on how to make a flanker task using jsPsych
- **Part2_FlankerTask.md**. Document detailing the step-by-step process of creating a flanker task using jsPsych
