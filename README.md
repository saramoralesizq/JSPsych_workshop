# JSPsych_workshop
This page contains all of the materials of the jsPsych workshop, in a bit of a confusing way. This is because when recording this session, the screen stayed static in the Powerpoint presentation, and step-by-step programming was not recorded.
In order to aid navigation, I have divided the material in three folders:

## Part 1. PowerPoint presentation on online research and jsPsych
This contains: 
- Powerpoint presentation
- Video of the powerpoint presentation

Note: You will notice a sudden jump to the end of the presentation. This is because the programming tutorial was not recorded.

## Part 2. Tutorial on how to create a webpage
This contains: 
- Document detailing the process of creating a sample web step-by-step
- The HTML file with the finished result of the sample web and a folder with the image that contained the image I used

## Part 3. Tutorial on how to make a flanker task using jsPsych
- Document detailing the process of creating a flanker task using jsPsych
- The HTML file containing the finished result
